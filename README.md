# Movie-Directory-Website
NOTE: *THIS WEBSITE WAS MADE WHEN I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT DATABASE CONNECTIONS. HENCE, A DIFF WEBPAGE FOR EACH MOVIE.*

Its a movie recommendation website
Experiment.html is the main page.
You need to turn off the bookmark bar in your browser
I have added 4 genres and each of them have 6 movies. I have not added more as it would drastically increase the number html files.

Once you click on browse movies on the main page you can select the genre and see the movies.
I have added IMDB & RottenTomatoes ratings with links of the page of the respective movie.
I also have added Trailers section on the page which plays a selected trailer and once it ends the user can select other trailer from the end suggestions of the trailer. 
All the watch options with links have been added. 

[It worked beautifully on my 1336x768 resolution screen but I am not sure if it would work on screen with different resolution]
